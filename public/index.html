            <p>There are many places where Christmas gnomes live and Tonttula is one of them. It is located near
        a big hill where there is a small village full of friendly people. Tonttula is quite small and old fashioned
        log house. The gnomes have given their consent to exhibit one room publicly.
            </p>
            <p>Before Chrismas the gnomes of Tonttula let people see in Instagram some photos and short videos of how they live and prepare for Christmas. People got to 
        know these gnomes quite well and found out that there are some elven neighbours as well as human ones. There are
        still many things and people that are unknown to others but the gnomes themself. This is why the gnomes have put their heads
        together and decided to tell the internet users more about themselves on this page You can also leave them a note in the guestbook.

            <p>Hi everyone! We wanted to tell you about our life. We think that everybody knows we gnomes are very bury
        during late autumn and especially just before Christms but what do we actually do during that time is the interesting part.
        Of course we help Santa to prepare some of the gifts but we like to have fun too. Some of us enjoy cooking and baking and
        others are more interested in decorating our home and garden. We have a dog and two cats living with us and they like it when 
        we gnomes play with them. Sometimes we listen to music and maybe even dance. In our garden there are often some half tame deer
        who tell us how the life in the forest is. Our family can speak with most animals. That is our special skill.
            </p>
            <p>We like to have good time so we use every occasion to make a small party. After New Year's Eve we have had at least the cake party
        at Valentine's Day and we went to slide the nearby slope and had some tasty shrove buns afterwords during Shrovetide. Now we are waiting
        for gnomes' special spring celebration at the beginning of April. During Eastertime we are looking forward to see our friends Easterbunny
        and Easterwitch. They come to say hello every year when they have finished their work for this year. 
            </p>
            <p>We have made some renovation in our house during the winter and we like our home even more now. Right now we are thinking if we should
        have electricity in our home as it is sometimes very hard to see with only candles and fireplace giving some light. We have not made any
        decicions yet so this remains to be seen. In the garden we prepared some flowerbeds in the autumn and when the spring
        comes we hope to see daffodils and tulips. Later we try to grow some vegetables but we have been a bit unlucky with them during last years.
            </p>
            <p>We like to see our family and friends and go visiting from time to time. We also like to have our nearest and dearest
        visiting us. Sometimes visitors just pop in while they are somewhere nearby and we offer them something to eat and drink. During summer
        we like to go on beach with all our friends and have good time swimming and enjoying the company. We have always
        some picnic lunch to share too. During the autumn we like especially to pick berries and mushrooms. We do lots of things outside all round the year.
            </p>
